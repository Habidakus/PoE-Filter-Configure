Simple utility program used while playing Path of Exile (by Grinding Gear Games)

While playing the end game of PoE it's important to generate Chaos Orb currency for trading, and one way to do that is to turn in full sets of unidentified 60+ gear.
In the course of collecting sets of gear you might have, say, too many helmets, while not enough belts. You can either keep an editor up all the time on your loot filter, or you can just run this program and have it update your loot filter as you identify just what parts of a full set you need to concentrate on.

When you first fire up the app, drag and drop the loot filter file you have been using onto the app. The app will back up the current loot filter into a file with the _pfc suffix.

Every time you make changes to the radio buttons in the app, you'll need to reload the filter in game (just as if you'd changed the filter using a text editor).
